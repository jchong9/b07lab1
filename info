The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with Java and Git, building a foundation for the rest of CSCB07.

In this lab, we are tasked to create a simple Java class that emulates the various aspects of a polynomial. This includes
adding properties like coefficients of a polynomial and incorporating methods that evaluate an nth-degree polynomial with an argument.
